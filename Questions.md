Q. _Each of the volumes of the jury book have been started but none are finished.  It seems odd to start a number of volumes but not finish any rather than to concentrate on just one volume.  Is the purpose of transcription to finish the jury books or to transcribe a little of each so that the software can learn to read the handwriting? Would it best to continue to work on volume 1?_

A. The idea is to finish each volume. It’s really up to the individual  transcriber whether they would prefer to work on a volume with others, or to work on ‘their own’ documents. As time goes on we might encourage people to finish specific volumes but for now I’m happy to have people work on what they prefer themselves.

Q. _I've looked at a few pages which have the orange corner on them and there are a few errors or questions on letters which seem actually clear. Can I amend them?_ 

A. Absolutely.


Q. _Should formatting of £sd be standardised in terms of periods or comma separators and the spaces between the elements of £sd?_

A. When transcribing it’s a matter of ‘write what you see’ so I would copy down whatever is on the page rather than standardising it.

Q. _I presume from looking at some pages that the each handwritten line should be on a separate line when transcribed, i.e., it shouldn't be typed as a Word paragraph._

A. The guidance on this is less clear. It is fine to format the typed text so that it follows the handwritten page e.g. starting new lines etc but it isn’t a hard requirement. I tend to put in line breaks for pages with lots of single sentences, but if transcribing a paragraph I don’t worry about it too much.

Q. _The page numbers aren't always included in transcribed pages but I assume they are important to add, formatting left or right so they mimic the handwritten page._

A. Yes, the page numbers should be inserted into the transcription.

Q. _What is the expected formatting of words that are capitalised though they wouldn't be capitalised in modern text? I have been including capitals though I note that others haven't always done so._

A. Yes, you should include the capitals if that reflects what is on the handwritten page.


Q. _The correct way to show abbreviations would be useful to know._

A. Again, it’s a matter of ‘write what you see’. If someone has written ‘Ltd.’ then that’s what should be transcribed, rather than ‘limited’.


Q. _I have transcribed prem(with an 'umlaut')es as 'prem..es'. Is this right?_ 

A. There is an option for ‘extended Latin’ characters if you select the Omega character circled above. This gives you the e with an umlaut character. If you find a letter with an accent mark you cannot source then just type the letter. Sometimes people use ‘…’ to show that text is illegible so I would avoid using periods for anything else.


Q. _If the writer has mis-spelt a word should I include '[sic]' after it?_

A. No. You should transcribe it as written. If you do want to make it clear that there is an error you could write ‘[sic]’ and put it in an information note as above.
